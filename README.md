# House Price Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other attributes. The prediction is done using machine learning models to assist in estimating property values accurately.

## Dataset

* **Source:** \[Provide dataset source link if applicable]
* **Description:** The dataset contains details about houses, including:

  * Location
  * Size (Square Feet)
  * Number of Bedrooms
  * Number of Bathrooms
  * Year Built
  * Other relevant features

## Features of the Project

* Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling)
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns
* Model training and evaluation
* Price prediction for new data inputs

## Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**

  * pandas
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * seaborn
  * scikit-learn
  * \[Add others if used]

workflow:
Load and explore the dataset

Clean and preprocess the data

Convert categorical variables into numerical form

Train a Linear Regression model

Evaluate performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score

Visualize results for better interpretation



## Results

The trained model predicts house prices with reasonable accuracy, providing a useful tool for real estate analysis.

## Future Improvements

* Include more features for better accuracy
* Deploy as a web application
* Add support for real-time data

If you want, I can also create a **requirements.txt** for this project so that it’s complete for GitHub.
Do you want me to prepare that?
